## 🚀 About Me

I'm the Founder and CEO of [DreamerAI](https://dreamerai.com), a startup focused on building the next generation of AI tools for creative expression. Based in the United States, I'm a serial entrepreneur with experience from top tech companies and prestigious educational institutions.

My passion lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity, particularly in generative AI technologies that empower people to express themselves in new ways.

## 🔭 Current Focus

I'm currently building [AI Tale](https://aitale.tech/) – a platform that leverages large language models to create personalized, illustrated children's stories. AI Tale generates richly illustrated online storybooks that spark imagination and make reading more engaging for children.

- 📚 **AI-generated stories** tailored to each child's interests
- 🎨 **Beautiful illustrations** created with state-of-the-art image generation
- 🌐 **Interactive online experience** for modern readers
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Tools for parents** to customize stories for their children
